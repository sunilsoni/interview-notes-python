'''Sure, here's an explanation of the code:

1. First, we define a function `inplace_reverse(file_path)` that takes the path of the file to be reversed as input.

2. Inside the function:
   - We set a `block_size` variable, which determines the size of the blocks of data that will be read and processed at a time. This helps manage memory usage, especially for large files.
   
   - We open the file in binary mode for both reading and writing (`'r+b'` mode).
   
   - We get the size of the file using `os.path.getsize(file_path)` to know the total size of the file in bytes.
   
   - We calculate the number of blocks based on the file size and the chosen `block_size`.
   
   - We iterate through half of the blocks (`num_blocks // 2`) to perform the reversal. We only need to go halfway through the file because we're swapping content from the beginning and end towards the middle.
   
   - Inside the loop:
     - We read a block of data from the start position and end position of the file.
     
     - We swap the content of these two blocks.
     
     - We move to the next pair of blocks.
     
   - After the loop, we handle any remaining bytes if the file size is not a multiple of the block size.
   
3. Example usage:
   - We call the `inplace_reverse` function with the path to the binary file we want to reverse.
   
   - The function reverses the content of the file in place, meaning it modifies the file directly without creating a new copy.

Overall, the code reads blocks of data from both ends of the file, swaps them, and repeats this process until the entire file is reversed. This approach efficiently handles large files by processing them in manageable chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory at once.
