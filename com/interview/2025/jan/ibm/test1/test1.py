### Refined Text from Extracted Data

---

### Problem Description

Sometimes it is necessary to filter a signal by frequency, e.g., to reduce noise outside of the expected frequency range. Filters can be stacked, allowing only the frequencies within the range allowed by all filters to pass through.

For example:
- Three filters with ranges of (10, 17), (13, 15), and (13, 17) will only allow signals between 13 and 15 through.
- The only range that all filters overlap is (13, 15).

Given `n` signals' frequencies and a series of `m` filters that allow frequencies in the range `x` to `y` (inclusive), determine the number of signals that will pass through all the filters. There will be **only one range** where all the filters overlap.

---

### Function Description

Complete the `countSignals` function below:

#### Function Signature:
```python
def countSignals(frequencies, filterRanges):
```

#### Parameters:
- `int frequencies[n]`: The frequencies of the signals sent through the filters.
- `int filterRanges[m][2]`: The lower and upper frequency bounds for each filter.

#### Returns:
- `int`: The number of signals that pass through all filters.

---

### Constraints:
- \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq \text{frequencies}[i] \leq 10^9\)
- \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq \text{filterRanges}[j][k] \leq 10^9\)

---

### Input Format for Custom Testing:

1. The first line contains an integer, `n`, the number of signal frequencies.
2. Each of the next `n` lines contains a single integer, `frequencies[i]`.
3. The next line contains an integer, `m`, the number of filters.
4. The next `m` lines each contain two space-separated integers, `filterRanges[j][0]` and `filterRanges[j][1]`, representing the lower and upper bounds of the pass-through range (inclusive).

---

### Example:

#### Input:
```
n = 5
frequencies = [8, 15, 14, 16, 21]
filterRanges = [[10, 17], [13, 15], [13, 17]]
```

#### Output:
```
2
```

#### Explanation:
- The overlapping range for all filters is (13, 15).
- Frequencies 15 and 14 fall within this range.
- Return `2`.

### Sample Cases

#### Case 0:
**Input:**
```
5
20
5
6
7
12
3
10 20
5 15
5 30
```

**Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The common pass-through range is (10, 15).
- Only frequency `12` passes through.

---

#### Case 1:
**Input:**
```
5
20
5
6
7
12
3
5 20
1 20
6 15
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- The common pass-through range is (6, 15).
- Frequencies 6, 7, and 12 pass through."""
