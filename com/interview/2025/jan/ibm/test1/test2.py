### Function Description

Complete the function `getOptimalPriority` in the editor below:

#### Function Signature:
```python
def getOptimalPriority(priority):
```

#### Parameters:
- `int priority[n]`: The priority sequence of the tasks.

#### Returns:
- `int[]`: The lexicographically smallest possible priority sequence after making any number of valid operations (including zero).

---

### Constraints
- \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- \(0 \leq \text{priority}[i] \leq 9\)

---

### Input Format for Custom Testing
1. The first line contains an integer `n`, the size of the array `priority`.
2. Each of the next `n` lines contains an integer `priority[i]`.

---

### Sample Cases:

#### Case 0:
**Input:**
```
4
0
7
0
9
```

**Output:**
```
[0, 0, 7, 9]
```

**Explanation:**
An optimal sequence of swaps is as follows:
- **Before Swapping**: [0, 7, 0, 9]
- **After Swapping**: [0, 0, 7, 9]

---

#### Case 1:
**Input:**
```
5
9
4
8
6
3
```

**Output:**
```
[4, 8, 6, 9, 3]
```

**Explanation:**
An optimal sequence of swaps is as follows:
- **Before Swapping**: [9, 4, 8, 6, 3]
- **After Swapping**: [4, 9, 8, 6, 3]
- **After Swapping**: [4, 8, 9, 6, 3]
- **After Swapping**: [4, 8, 6, 9, 3]

The lexicographically smallest possible priority sequence is `[4, 8, 6, 9, 3]`.
