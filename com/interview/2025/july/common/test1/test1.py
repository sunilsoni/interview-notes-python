Question: Given n processes with start times starts[] and end times ends[],
find the minimum number of processes to drop so that the remaining processes
form a synchronized set (i.e., there is at least one process whose interval
overlaps with every other in the set).

Input: two lists of integers, starts and ends, each of length n.
Output: integer, minimum drops.

Example 1:
starts = [2,3,2,6,4]
ends   = [3,4,4,7,6]
Answer = 1

Example 2:
starts = [1,3,4,6,9]
ends   = [2,8,5,7,10]
Answer = 2

### ðŸ”§ Problem: Minimum Process Drops for Synchronization

A team of developers at Amazon is working on process synchronization. One way to achieve process synchronization is through effective inter-process communication. Processes can communicate with each other through shared memory, i.e., by accessing the same resources while executing simultaneously.

---

### ðŸ§© Definition:

A **set of processes is synchronized** if **there is at least one process** in the set whose **execution time overlaps** with the execution times of **all other processes** in the set.

---

### ðŸ§ª Your Task:

Given the starting and ending times of execution of `n` processes in the arrays `starts[]` and `ends[]`, determine the **minimum number of processes** that must be dropped so the remaining processes form a synchronized set.

> **Note**: A set containing only one process is considered to be synchronized.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Function Signature:

```python
def findMinimumProcessDrops(starts: List[int], ends: List[int]) -> int:
```

**Parameters**:

* `starts[]`: List of integers representing start times of the processes.
* `ends[]`: List of integers representing end times of the processes.

**Returns**:

* Integer representing the **minimum number of processes to remove** to leave a synchronized set.

---

### âœ… Constraints:

* $1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5$
* $1 \leq \text{starts[i]} \leq \text{ends[i]} \leq 10^9$
* No two intervals have identical `[start, end]` pairs.

---

### ðŸ“¥ Input Format:

* The first line contains an integer `n`, the size of `starts[]`.
* The next `n` lines each contain an integer `starts[i]`.
* Then another integer `n` indicating the size of `ends[]`.
* The next `n` lines each contain an integer `ends[i]`.

---

```

* Remove interval `[6, 7]` â†’ Remaining: `[2, 3], [3, 4], [2, 4], [4, 6]`
* `[2, 4]` intersects with all other intervals. âœ…

#### Explanation:

Execution intervals:

```
[1, 2], [3, 8], [4, 5], [6, 7], [9, 10]
```

* Remove `[1, 2]` and `[9, 10]`
* Remaining: `[3, 8], [4, 5], [6, 7]` â†’ `[3, 8]` overlaps with all others âœ…
